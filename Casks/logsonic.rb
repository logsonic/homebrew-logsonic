  caveats <<~EOS
    LogSonic stores its search index under:
      ~/Library/Application Support/Logsonic
    This directory grows with the logs you ingest. To cap it, run logsonic with
    --retention-days N (or set RETENTION_DAYS). To delete all indexed data when
    uninstalling, run:
      brew uninstall --zap logsonic
